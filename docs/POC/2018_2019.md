## Docker Project

### Needs

This project was made to replace the Ubuntu 18.04 partition witch a Docker image. The main goal of the project was to eliminate dependencies with the operating system to allow developpers to choose the operating system of their choice.


### Project Deadlock

The main problems encountered were the implementation of the graphical interface in the docker and the installation of the DALSA drivers. Regarding the implementation of the graphical interface, the software team found as a solution to replace the telemetry programmed with RQT by a server that would send data to a web browser. for the drivers installation, no solutions were found. This project was abandonned since the team effort was not worth the outcome. This project archive can be found on [github](https://github.com/sonia-auv/docker_test)
